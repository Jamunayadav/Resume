        <h2>Internships</h2>
        <h3>1stop.ai
            <p>Intern</p></h3>
            <p>Remote Aug 2022- Dec 2022</p> 
            <p><h3>Project Title:</h3> During my internship, I embarked on a fascinating journey of conducting a Hierarchical Clustering Analysis for Customer Segmentation, a project that allowed me to delve deep into the world of data science. Armed with Python and the powerful scikit-learn library, I ventured into the realm of customer data, where I meticulously preprocessed and analyzed the vast troves of information at hand. My primary objective was to unveil the hidden insights within this sea of data, ultimately resulting in the identification of five distinct customer segments, each possessing unique and intriguing purchasing patterns.
            
               <p>This project was not merely an exercise in data manipulation and analysis but a remarkable opportunity to harness the true potential of data-driven decision-making. As I navigated the intricacies of hierarchical clustering, I unearthed the inherent structure within the customer data, shedding light on previously undiscovered relationships and behaviors. This exploration enabled businesses to tailor their strategies to cater to each customer segment's specific needs and preferences, thereby enhancing their overall performance and competitiveness.</p>
